## Get Started

### Download
Download the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bifrost-proxy/VoiceInk/releases/latest).

#### Homebrew
Install VoiceInk from the Bifrost Proxy Homebrew tap:

```shell
brew install --cask bifrost-proxy/voiceink/voiceink
```

Homebrew requires the fully qualified `owner/tap/cask` form for a one-line third-party Cask install. The equivalent two-step form is:

```shell
brew tap bifrost-proxy/voiceink
brew install --cask voiceink
```

For upgrades, use `brew upgrade --cask --greedy voiceink` because the tap follows the latest GitHub Release.
